The [DatArchive API](/docs/apis/dat.html) provides a simple set of APIs to listen for changes to a file, whether the file is locally owned or remote. After instantiating an archive instance and making changes, you can call `createFileActivityStream()`.

## `createFileActivityStream`

Start with the [site you created in the Writing site files tutorial](http://localhost:4000/docs/tutorials/write-site-files.html). Add the following code to the end of the main function:

<figcaption class="code">js/index.js</figcaption>
```js
var fileEvents = archive.createFileActivityStream()
fileEvents.addEventListener('invalidated', e => {
  console.log(e.path, 'invalidated')
})
fileEvents.addEventListener('changed', e => {
  console.log(e.path, 'changed')
})
```

Refresh the page, then enter this snippet into the devtools console:

<figcaption class="code">snippet</figcaption>
```js
var archive = new DatArchive(localStorage.targetDatURL)
archive.writeFile('/foo.txt', 'bar')
```

You should see this appear in your console:

<figure>
<img data-src="/img/docs/tut-listen-for-file-changes/changed.png" >
<figcaption>The 'changed' event</figcaption>
</figure>

The `'changed'` event fires any time the file has been updated on your local disk.

The `'invalidated'` event fires any time a file has been updated by a remote author. It informs you that the file has been changed remotely, but that change has not yet been downloaded.

So, if an archive is local:

- Only `'changed'` will fire, when the file changes.

But if an archive is remote:

- `'invalidated'` will fire when the metadata update is downloaded
- `'changed'` will fire when the new content is downloaded
