One of Beaker’s most powerful features comes from the Dat protocol’s
approach to transport secrecy. As explained in [Inside Beaker: Privacy
and security](/docs/how-beaker-works/privacy-and-security.html
#transport-security), a Dat URL is “secret.” It is unguessable, and
encrypted in transit. This means:

*Only users that possess a Dat URL can access its files.*

To share files secretly, [create a new Dat](/docs/using-beaker/create-a-site.html) and use a private channel to send the URL to your intended recipients.

After transferring the files, remove the Dat from your library. Removing a Dat doesn’t delete your local copy of the files; it just stops Beaker from hosting the files, so that nobody can download them.
