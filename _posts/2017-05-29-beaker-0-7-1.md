## Swarm debugger

The swarm debugger is a tool for technical users to diagnose connectivity problems.

</figure>

Use it to detect whether a target recipient is connecting, and to watch for error events or failures.

### How to open the debugger

You can open the Swarm debugger from the library page of an archive.

We'll continue to add features to the debugger over time.

## How to install

If you already have Beaker installed on OSX, you can use the auto-updater to get latest. **However, [due to a bug in Beaker 0.7](https://twitter.com/BeakerBrowser/status/869230831935606785), you will need to use the settings page.**

If you're running Linux or if you're new to Beaker, [download the new version here](/install.html).
