  We believe the Web is at its best when it empowers creation and encourages
  participation. That's why we're building a browser for a <br>
  <em>person-to-person Web</em>.
</p>

## Our mission

The Web enabled communication, collaboration, and creativity at a scale
once unimaginable, but it's devolved into a landscape of of isolated platforms
that discourage customization and interoperability. The Web's value
flows from the people who use it, yet our
[online experiences](https://twitter.com/prozdkp/status/978344325456318465)
are dictated by corporations whose incentives rarely align with our own.

We believe the Web can (and must) be a people-first platform, where everybody
is invited to create, personalize, and share. We've set out to make it so.

### Why build a browser?

Browsers are the gateway to the Web! By building a browser with experimental
features and capabilities, we have the flexibility to explore how the browser
can help uphold the vision of an open Web.

## History

Paul released the [Beaker prototype](https://twitter.com/pfrazee/status/763737371376365568)
in August 2016 after participating in the inaugral
[Decentralized Web Summit](https://decentralized-web.net), where he shopped his
idea to integrate peer-to-peer protocols into a browser.

Tara made her first contribution in October 2016 and joined full-time in April 2017.
As core developer of the [Dat protocol](https://datprotocol.com),
Mathias has always been a part of the Beaker community, but he
[officially joined](https://twitter.com/mafintosh/status/989214862764118016) the
Beaker team in 2018.

## Team

Beaker is a project by [Blue Link Labs](https://bluelinklabs.com), a team of
developers who love the Web.
